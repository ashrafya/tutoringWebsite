#### Business Plan

I am trying to design a tutoring website. How should the layout of the website be? I will be offering both personal tutoring and group tutoring lessons. I want this to be a single page website. I need to have the following sections at least. Navbar, Hero section, about, features, pricing, pathway/timeline/how it works section, footer. I will not be accepting payment via the website. I will be asking clients to fill out forms depensing on what they are interested in. How can I direct them to these forms. whta is the best way to build this website. please give me a lyout of this website in markdown. I have also set up google analytics on my website.

I need people to visit my website and I want to have at least 30 students signed up by the end of this month. I also want to encourage people to click the regstration link
